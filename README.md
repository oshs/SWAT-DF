## Dynamic Feedback Coupling between SWAT (Rev_692_64) and Positive Multi-Attribute Utility Programming (PMAUP) Model

SWAT-DF is a customized implementation of the SWAT that enables dynamic, interannual coupling with a microeconomic model (PMAUP). The framework introduces a two-way feedback mechanism between hydrological processes and land-use decisions.

### Conceptual Framework

The dynamic feedback (DF) protocol operates through an annual two-way exchange:

#### Hydrological Simulation (SWAT)
SWAT simulates basin-scale water balance components and reservoir dynamics.

#### Water Restriction Assessment
Reservoir storage thresholds determine applicable water restriction (WR) levels (0%, 25%, 50%, 100%).

#### Economic Response (PMAUP)
PMAUP adjusts crop portfolios and irrigation decisions in response to WR conditions.

#### Land-Use Update (SWAT-DF)
Updated crop portfolios are translated into HRU-level fractional areas (hru_fr) and incorporated into SWAT before the next simulation year.

### Example Inputs

This repository includes example input files required to run the dynamic feedback (DF) protocol. In particular, three example files are provided, corresponding to crop portfolio configurations generated by the microeconomic model (PMAUP) under different water restriction (WR) levels:

LupInput25 – 25% water reduction

LupInput50 – 50% water reduction

LupInput100 – 100% water restriction

Each file contains the simulated land-use configuration (crop portfolio) associated with the corresponding WR scenario. These outputs are translated into HRU-level fractional areas (hru_fr) and are read dynamically by SWAT-DF at each annual coupling step.

During simulation, SWAT evaluates reservoir storage conditions and determines the applicable WR level. The corresponding PMAUP output file is then accessed and used to update HRU land-use fractions before the next hydrological year begins. This mechanism enables the endogenous adjustment of crop allocation and irrigation demand in response to evolving water availability.

The repository will continue to be updated with improvements, additional examples, and extended documentation as the framework evolves.
